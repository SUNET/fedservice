# Federation example

This set of directories allows you to set up 2 federations, together
containing two RPs, an OP, two intermediates and 2 trust anchors.

The trust anchors controls two federations (SEID and SWAMID).

The two organizations (UMU&LU) both belong to both federations.

UMU has one subordinate an OP.
LU has two subordinates; one RP that does automatic registration and another
that does explicit registration.
